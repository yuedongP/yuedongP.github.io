I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science in the [Reasoning and Learning lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) at [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) and also a Ph.D. student at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/), supervised by [Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). I am broadly interested in the research area of artificial intelligence, deep learning and natural language processing.

I received my master's degree in [mathematics]() from University of Ottawa in 2016, under the co-supervision of [Vladimir Pestov](https://sites.google.com/site/vpestov2010/home) and [Nathalie Japkowicz](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nat/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree with a major in mathematics and minor in computer science from University of Ottawa in 2014. Previously, I studied [Clinical Medicine](http://www.med.xjtu.edu.cn/) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) (西安交通大学）from 2019-2020 after gaokao (高考).

In fall 2018 I interned as a Research Scientist at [Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home). In winter 2020 I interned with [Shuohang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mN-IO6wAAAAJ&hl=de), [Zhe Gan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/zhgan/), [Yu Cheng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yucheng1/) and [Jingjing Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jingjl/) at Microsoft in Redmond. In summer and fall 2020 I interned with [Chandra Bhagavatula](https://allenai.org/team/chandrab) and [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) at AI2 in Seattle. I am grateful to have been supported by NSERC [CGS D](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsd-bescd_eng.asp) scholarship.
