I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science in the [Reasoning and Learning lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) at [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) and also a Ph.D. student at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/), supervised by [Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). I am broadly interested in the research area of artificial intelligence, deep learning and natural language processing.

I received my master's degree in mathematics from University of Ottawa in 2016, under the co-supervision of Dr. Vladimir Pestov and Dr. Nathalie Japkowicz. My master's thesis can be found here. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree with a major in mathematics and minor in computer science from University of Ottawa in 2014. In addition, I studied Clinical Medicine at Xi'an Jiaotong University (西安交通大学）from 2019-2020 after gaokao (高考).
